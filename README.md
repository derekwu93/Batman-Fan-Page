# Batman Fan Page: Legacy of The Dark Knight

## Objective

I was tasked with developing a low-fidelity wireframe that included a video (YouTube).  At the time, I chose to focus on a Batman Fan Page because The Batman (2022), starring Robert Pattinson, was being released within a few weeks, and I was excited to see the film.  The wireframe contains a brief description of Batman’s continued legacy in relation to the film, as well as the last trailer released prior to the movie’s premiere.

## Synopsis

This project is similar in structure to fan pages commonly found online, but it stands out through its focus on celebrating Batman’s ongoing legacy and connecting fans around the excitement of The Batman (2022).  While it doesn’t reference a specific existing website, it was inspired by my desire to create a Batman fan page that felt more engaging and immersive than others I had encountered.   

## Process

I used Sublime Text for the HTML and CSS coding for the foundational blocks of the website.  One of the challenges I faced was deciding on the color scheme.  I considered either black and red (colors used in the 2022 film) or the notorious black and yellow.  Ultimately, I chose black and yellow to match the iconic Batman logo that everyone knows and loves. 

Next, I determined what content to include on the Home page.  I decided to provide a general overview for visitors explaining why they might want to explore the site.  Additionally, I embedded the last trailer for The Batman (2022), allowing visitors to watch it directly on the website rather than searching on social media platforms.

Finally, I added two navigation buttons and pages, which are still in development as they were outside the original project scope.  The Across the Multiverse page will serve as a library of all Batman appearances across various media.  The Fan Art page is designed to showcase fan creations; visitors will be able to email pictures of their art for publication on the website.

## Results

The website was completed on time with zero budget.  The project offers fans an engaging space to explore Batman’s legacy and the latest content related to The Batman (2022).  The website can be viewed in full at the following link:
